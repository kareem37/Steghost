Time Complexity Analysis:
    help module
        compute_data_size: O(d), where d is the size of the data size array.
    data_reader module
        read_bin_file_to_bits: O(n), where n is the size of the file.
        get_pixels_array_channels: O(h * w), where h and w are the height and width of the image.
    pixel_permutation module
        permute_pixels: O(n log n), primarily due to the permutation process.
        reverse_permute_pixels: O(n log n), due to the sorting step.
    encoding module
        matrix_encode: O(m), where m is the number of message bits.
        f5_embed: O(n log n + m), due to permutation and encoding processes.
        Data_Distributer: O(1), primarily consists of condition checks and array slicing.
    image_reconstruction module
        get_image: O(h * w), reshaping and stacking arrays to reconstruct the image.
    Total Execution Time
        The total time complexity for the F5_Steganography function will be approximately:
        
        O(n + h * w + n log n + m)
In practice, since image height and width (h, w) and file size (n) are the dominant factors, the overall time complexity is primarily determined by these values.
